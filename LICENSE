#NYC Hikes

Welcome to NYC Hikes!!
This is a website that will allow the user to search up any hiking trails in New York City. (Yes, there are hiking trails in the huge concrete jungle.)

##User Navigation

A user can easily choose an option of a hiking trail from a drop down menu, which will be separated by boroughs for easier navigation. Upon choosing which trial he or she chooses, a Google map will appear below the options on where the hiking trail is located. Along with the map for directions, a short description of the park, the length of the hike and the difficulty of the hike.
